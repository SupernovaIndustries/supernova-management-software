# Supernova Management System - Progress Session 3

## Date: January 2025

## Completed Features

### 1. Fixed Type Hint Error
- Fixed `handleRecordUpdate` method signature in `EditProjectPcbFile.php`
- Added missing `Model` import statement
- Resolved compatibility issue with Filament's EditRecord class

### 2. ArUco Code System for Components
Complete implementation of ArUco code generation and scanning system:

#### Backend Implementation:
- **Migration**: Added ArUco fields to components table
  - `aruco_code`: Unique identifier (format: ARUCO-000001)
  - `aruco_image_path`: Path to generated ArUco image
  - `aruco_generated_at`: Timestamp of generation

- **ArUcoService**: Complete service for ArUco management
  - `generateArUcoCode()`: Creates unique ArUco codes
  - `generateArUcoImage()`: Generates 4x4 ArUco marker images with component info
  - `findByArUcoCode()`: Lookup component by code
  - `generatePrintSheet()`: Creates printable HTML sheets with multiple ArUco codes

#### Filament UI Implementation:
- **ArUco Scanner Page** (`/admin/aruco-scanner`):
  - Live camera scanning interface
  - Manual code entry option
  - Real-time component information display
  - Direct links to edit component

- **Component Resource Updates**:
  - Added ArUco code column in table view
  - Generate ArUco action for individual components
  - View ArUco modal with download option
  - Bulk ArUco generation for multiple components
  - Print ArUco sheet for batch printing

### 3. Interactive BOM (iBOM) System
Project-centric interactive BOM viewer inspired by KiCad's iBOM:

#### Backend Implementation:
- **InteractiveBomService**: 
  - Groups components by reference designator
  - Calculates statistics (total cost, sourced percentage)
  - Generates interactive HTML with search, filters, and component details
  - Links component status (placed, sourced, missing)

#### Filament UI Implementation:
- **Interactive BOM Viewer Page** (`/admin/interactive-bom`):
  - Project and BOM version selection
  - Real-time iBOM generation
  - Embedded viewer with full interactivity
  - Download HTML for offline use
  - Open in new tab for full-screen view

#### Features:
- Component search and filtering
- Status-based filtering (All, Placed, Sourced, Missing)
- Click-to-view component details
- Cost calculations and statistics
- Reference designator grouping
- Responsive design for mobile use

### 4. PCB Design Integration Enhancements
- Fixed all type hint issues in PCB file resources
- Added PCB file statistics widget
- Created comparison view template
- Integrated with iBOM for complete project view

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Service Architecture
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated services
- Reusable components for ArUco and iBOM generation
- Proper error handling and notifications

### 2. UI/UX Enhancements
- Modal dialogs for ArUco viewing
- Responsive layouts for all new features
- Consistent styling with existing Filament theme
- Print-optimized layouts for ArUco sheets

### 3. Database Structure
- Non-breaking migrations for ArUco fields
- Proper indexes for performance
- Maintained data integrity

## Next Steps & TODOs

### High Priority:
1. **UnLook Panel Integration**
   - Design panel interface for 3D scanning integration
   - Implement Arduino-based computer vision features
   - Create API endpoints for UnLook device communication

2. **Gerber Viewer Integration**
   - Integrate actual Gerber file viewer
   - Link with iBOM for component highlighting
   - Add PCB layer visualization

3. **ArUco Hardware Integration**
   - Implement actual ArUco detection library (OpenCV.js)
   - Add webcam calibration settings
   - Support for mobile camera scanning

### Medium Priority:
1. **Enhanced BOM Features**
   - BOM comparison history
   - Cost optimization suggestions
   - Alternative component recommendations

2. **Component Lifecycle Improvements**
   - Automated EOL notifications
   - Supplier availability tracking
   - Price trend analysis

3. **Production Features**
   - Assembly instructions generation
   - Pick-and-place file generation
   - Test procedure documentation

### Low Priority:
1. **Reporting & Analytics**
   - Component usage reports
   - Project cost analysis
   - Inventory turnover metrics

2. **Integration Enhancements**
   - More supplier APIs
   - CAD software plugins
   - ERP system connectors

## Migration Notes
Remember to run:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Configuration Notes
- Ensure storage symlink exists: `php artisan storage:link`
- ArUco images are stored in `storage/app/public/aruco/`
- iBOM files are stored in `storage/app/public/ibom/`

## Dependencies to Install
For full ArUco functionality, consider adding:
```bash
composer require endroid/qr-code
```

For advanced image processing:
```bash
composer require intervention/image
```
